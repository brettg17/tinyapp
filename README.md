# TinyApp Project

This project, TinyApp, was done as a learning opportunity while attending Lighthouse labs. It is a full stack web application built with Node and Express. Once the application is started the user will be asked to "register" or "log in". After that is done, the user will then be able to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
